# Welcome to InQL contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to InQL!

## Where to send patches

The development is happening in **dev** branches, so this is where you should be sending pull requests (not the default **main** branches, as they only contain released code).

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Check out the 'dev' branch
3. Compile the existing code by following the instructions inside of the `README.md` file 
4. Make changes in your fork
5. Create pull request to the 'dev' branch, explain the rationale in the message or link to an issue that is solved by PR
