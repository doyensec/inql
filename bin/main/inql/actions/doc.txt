Actions Package contains all the contextual actions needed to operate in a BURP Extension context.
Ideally an action will generate a contextual menu item (left click, eg. in InQL Tab).

Each and every *Action* class MUST implement a ctx(self, host=None, payload=None, fname=None) method
and expose a menuitem field in order to be included in a menuitem array.
